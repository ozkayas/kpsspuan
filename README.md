Calculates exact KPSS scores for past years

## Motivation

Years ago I had figured out a mathematical way to exactly calculate Kpss scores as per data of past
years. I had a website [www.kpsspuan.net](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/www.kpsspuan.net) for such calculations,
including blog posts about the exam.

So, I decided to create my first Flutter app in memory of www.kpsspuan.net :)
